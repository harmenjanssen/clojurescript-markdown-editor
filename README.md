# Markdownify

Little app made in the Clojurescript course: https://purelyfunctional.tv/courses/markdown-editor/

Run:

```
shadow-cljs watch app
```

Conclusion:

Nice to get some experience with Clojurescript. Hot reloading with persistent state works really nice.  
React... why is this React? The bundle clocks in at almost 100KB! Sigh, this proofs my preference for vanilla JS once again.
This whole app could probably be a tenth of the payload.
